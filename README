== Testing/Sample Code

Logica provides an SMPP simulator that you can download from opensmpp.logica.com. You can also sign up for a demo SMPP account at one of the many bulk-SMS providers out there.

For a quick test, download smscsim.jar and smpp.jar from the Logica site, and start the simulator by typing:

	java -cp smscsim.jar:smpp.jar com.logica.smscsim.Simulator
	java -cp smpptest.java com.logica.smpp.SMPPTest.java
